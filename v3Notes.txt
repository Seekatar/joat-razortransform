V3 Refactoring notes

*Bugs
If RtValues passed in not found, it will read on that exists with rtobject!  Even in old code
Settings doesn't show override output folder, title bar does

*ToDo
Settings needs to keep its own ModelConfig.  Need to be attached to root.  IRootModel?  Customs loaded once, from both Settings, & main file
Calling Instance.On*?  Shouldn't be in model
VariableItems has MSI specific names
Unittest for transforms
@Model examples in sample
Add "Saved" indicator or disable if not dirty?

*New Features
VisiblityGroups
Search and replace, already have recursive find
Add double support
Nested Groups/Models for RtThySelf
Support setting arrays using keys 
Right click an item to copy @Model value to clipboard

*Doc changes
Label
Numbers now all Int64 internally, use limits to restrict

*Resolved
no -- Do I need CopyValuesFrom in iface?
nah, label is good -- Add "helptext" type that just shows text in multiple line control  Html??
fixed -- When can we set IsPassword??
fixed -- (old version would not get error at all, now show it)  If get exception in expansion, exits app. e.g. Set @Model.junk on something, when refreshes, 
	exits instead of just showing message. 
	Shouldn't show the message on refresh anyway?  Old exe doesn't
No, it shows error and stops loading XML, like any other XML error -- When loading Min/Max if attr has bad value, does it blow up?
fixed -- Model.CurrentSettings not getting set

*New Model
IModel
	has Items <IItemBase>
	has Parent <IModel>

IItemBase
	has Parent <IModel>, Name, Desc, IGroup
	IItem
		has Value, ExpandedValue
	IItemList
		has Key, Sort (enum), Unique
		Implements IList<Model>, 

IGroup
	has Name, Desc, Visibility

Old names -> new names
TransformModel -> ModelConfig (Enums, Regexes, etc) and IModel Model
TransformModelItem -> IItem, Item
TransformModelArray -> IItemList, ItemList
	ItemList has array of Models
	ItemList knows how to make display name for the Model
PropertyName -> Name
