Notes

*Bugs


*ToDo
Allow passing in XML to populate Enum.  PS is ok, but quirky.  Get Count() error way down in PS when running the ABL populate script without
	file input, even though it does Test-Path for it
Settings needs to keep its own ModelConfig.  Need to be attached to root.  IRootModel?  Customs loaded once, from both Settings, & main file
Calling Instance.On*?  Shouldn't be in model
VariableItems has MSI specific names
Unittest for transforms
Add "Saved" & "Refreshed" indicator/toast or disable if not dirty?
Test command line index override

*New Features
VisiblityGroups
Search and replace, already have recursive find
Add double support
Nested Groups/Models for RtThySelf

*Doc changes
multiline
export all overrides into PS (removed LW-specific code)
EnumFromArrayType
Label
Numbers now all Int64 internally, use limits to restrict
Overriding index on command line
@Model with index 

*Resolved
4/2 If default directory doesn't have a Templates folder, then doesn't find anything and quickly exits.  Should warn if no templates found
4/2 - 3/27/15 Passwords set in Artie have no way to get to PS if running from CLI
4/2 - 3/27/15 Should prompt "Do you want to cancel?" If hit Esc while PS is running
added Right click an item to copy @Model value to clipboard
added Double click on array item for edit.  Notes -- Thought about just doing dbl-click in edit control since now it does it 
    for buttons, too.  But since disabled, don't get dblclick.  Could use TextBlock and catch LButton down with count of 2
	and fire our own even, then dbl click on buttons does button (which is probably how it used to work.)
added PS script to populate Enum
added @Model examples in sample
fixed Numbers can't use @Model TEMP changed to use _Default control
fixed 11/15 -- If RtValues passed in not found, it will read one that exists with rtobject!  Even in old code
fixed 11/15 -- If have validation violation, can never save.  Should prompt to allow saving.
fixed 11/15, wasn't doing settings right at all. -- Settings doesn't show override output folder, title bar does
no -- Do I need CopyValuesFrom in iface?
nah, label is good -- Add "helptext" type that just shows text in multiple line control  Html??
fixed -- When can we set IsPassword??
fixed -- (old version would not get error at all, now show it)  If get exception in expansion, exits app. e.g. Set @Model.junk on something, when refreshes, 
	exits instead of just showing message. 
	Shouldn't show the message on refresh anyway?  Old exe doesn't
No, it shows error and stops loading XML, like any other XML error -- When loading Min/Max if attr has bad value, does it blow up?
fixed -- Model.CurrentSettings not getting set
Done -- Support setting arrays using keys 
fixed -- Indexing into array works, but @Model.Array[0].name doesn't work right.
fixed -- Length of string needs to be enforced for value, not orig, e.g. "@Model.test"

*New Model
IModel
	has Items <IItemBase>
	has Parent <IModel>

IItemBase
	has Parent <IModel>, Name, Desc, IGroup (no longer group class, but just an attribute)
	IItem
		has Value, ExpandedValue
	IItemList
		has Key, Sort (enum), Unique
		Implements IList<Model>, 

IGroup
	has Name, Desc, Visibility

Old names -> new names
TransformModel -> ModelConfig (Enums, Regexes, etc) and IModel Model
TransformModelItem -> IItem, Item
TransformModelArray -> IItemList, ItemList
	ItemList has array of Models
	ItemList knows how to make display name for the Model
PropertyName -> Name
